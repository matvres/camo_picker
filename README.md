Camouflage families:
--------------------


**BRUSHSTROKE**  
One of the grandfathers of camouflage.
First used by the United Kingdom it quickly influenced other countries like Belgium and France (the Lizard pattern) to do their own versions of this pattern in the 1950s and 1960s.
You will still find it in use in countries like Pakistan or Zimbabwe (which inherited it from Rhodesia).


**CHOCOLATE CHIP**  
Officially called “Six Colour Desert”, it became widely known because of the First US Gulf War, just like the subtler version “Three Colour Desert”.
It became so popular it is still in use by various Middle Eastern countries in different variations.


**DPM**  
The British “Disruptive Pattern Material”.
Just like M81 Woodland, it has become one of the most used camouflage patterns in a variety of copies and colour schemes.


**DIGITAL PATTERNS**  
Digital is not necessarily pixelated camouflage – a wide misconception! In fact, digital patterns are those which are computer and algorithm based.
There have been pixelated patterns long before Canada started issuing pixelated uniforms in the late 1990s.
The USMC followed this example and created MARPAT in 2001. But while CADPAT or MARPAT might be digitally designed, so are Vegetato, Multicam etc.


**DUCK HUNTER**  
One of the lesser known patterns in Europe, this has its origins in the American M1942 spot camouflage of WW2. Used mainly in the war in the Pacific, its descendants can be found in Asia, but also Latin- and South America. The Australian DPCU is also considered a “relative”.


**FLECKTARN**  
The result of the Bundeswehr Truppenversuch 76, it is not only a trademark of Germany, but also led to several similar designs in Belgium, China, Denmark and Poland.


**LEAF**  
In 1948 the US Army Engineer Research and Development Laboratory created the so called ERDL pattern, which is not only synonymous with the Vietnam War, but also influenced several other patterns.
A 60% enlarged version became M81 Woodland and other countries use it one way or the other.


**PUZZLE**  
These are quite unique, especially when considering that several came up independently in the 20th century. Starting with Belgium, but also the Philippines and Yugoslavia.


**RAIN**  
The design element of “rain” was initially inherent in German WW2 patterns, mimicking grass.
Later onwards Warsaw Pact countries used the vertical lines on solid colour, creating visual noise and being very effective against night vision devices.


**SPLITTER**  
Even though the Splittertarn pattern is closely associated with WW2, it is still widely in use.
While Switzerland used it until 1955, it was also the initial camouflage of the German Bundeswehr and Bundesgrenzschutz. There are several variations in Bulgaria and the Swedish M90 is the most modern variant today.


**TIGERSTRIPE**  
A “cousin” of Brushstroke, it was inspired by the French Lizard design. Quickly becoming something of its own, it can be found in various jungle environments.
